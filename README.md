### Alignment of recordings across imaging sessions

Code to align calcium imaging recordings from different sessions but with the same FOV is in the [Alignment](https://github.com/mchini/Yang_Chini_et_al/tree/master/Alignment%20Scripts%20(Python)) folder.

### Analysis of calcium transients and their correlations

Python code for analysis of calcium transients and correlation matrices is in [Figures 3-5](https://github.com/mchini/Yang_Chini_et_al/tree/master/Figures%203-5%20(Python)) folder

### Clustering and classification

Matlab code for clustering in the spatial and temporal domain and sleep classification is in the [Figures 5-7](https://github.com/mchini/Yang_Chini_et_al/tree/master/Figures%205-7%20(MATLAB)) folder

### Electrophysiology

Further Matlab code that was used for the ephys-part of the paper can be found in this other [repository](https://github.com/mchini/HanganuOpatzToolbox)

R scripts and datasets that were used for all statistical analysis are available in the [Stats](https://github.com/mchini/Yang_Chini_et_al/tree/master/Stats%20(R)) folder.

Raw 2-photon and electrophysiology data is available at this [repository](https://gin.g-node.org/SW_lab/Anesthesia_CA1/) on GIN.

## Notebooks

**Analysis of neuronal activity on single neuron level**

Extraction of the main features permits the analysis of the recordings on both population and single neuron levels.

**Validation of calcium recordings: homogeneity and stability**

This notebook illustrates the extraction of the main features of the calcium traces for a large set of recordings and subsiquest analysis it's variations and stability.
